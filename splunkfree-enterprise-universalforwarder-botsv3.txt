SPLUNK FREE - SPLUNK ENTERPRISE, SPLUNK 
UNIVERSAL FORWARDER, and BOTS Dataset
**************************************************
==================================================
PREFACE
==================================================
This document describes how to install the Splunk Free versions of Splunk Enterprise and the Splunk Universal Forwarder on separate servers running Rocky Linux.

Splunk Enterprise is a software platform that can be used to search, analyze, and visualize data gathered from components of an IT infrastructure.

The Splunk Forwarder collects data on a target server and forwards it to the server running Splunk Enterprise for indexing and consolidation.

The major limitations of the Splunk Free versions are the license volume restriction and removed features.

Boss of the SOC (BOTS) is a free sample security dataset that can be used to practice creating search queries on the Splunk server.

		$ cd /opt/splunk/bin
		$ ./splunk start --accept-license
		
		ATTENTION:	You will be prompted to enter an administrator username then enter and confirm a password

	Log out of the splunk user account and return to the root login
		$ exit
	Configure Splunk to start on boot
		# cd /opt/splunk/bin
		# ./splunk enable boot-start -user splunk
	Reboot the server
		# reboot
